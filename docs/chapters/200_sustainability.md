# 200 — Sustainability

This chapter introduces **system-level thinking about climate impact**, focusing on how emissions translate into long-term environmental consequences.

Rather than starting from complex Earth System Models, we use **intentionally simplified climate models** to make the *causal structure* explicit:
emissions → concentrations → radiative forcing → temperature response.

The objective is not prediction, but **mechanistic understanding**.

## Why this matters for aircraft propulsion

In sustainable aircraft propulsion, engineering decisions often reduce to:

- fuel choice,
- efficiency improvements,
- operational changes.

All of these ultimately act through **emissions**.

To evaluate whether a technological option is *meaningful* in a climate context, engineers must understand:

- why CO₂ accumulates,
- why temperature responds slowly,
- why short-term reductions do not immediately reverse warming.

This chapter provides that foundation.

## Learning outcomes 

After completing this chapter, you should be able to:

- Explain the difference between **emissions**, **concentrations**, **forcing**, and **temperature**
- Describe why **net-zero does not mean instant temperature stabilization**
- Identify the key time scales governing climate response
- Critically assess claims such as *“this technology reduces temperature by X°C”*

These skills will be reused later when discussing:

- Sustainable Aviation Fuels
- Hydrogen
- Non-CO₂ effects
- Scenario building and uncertainty
