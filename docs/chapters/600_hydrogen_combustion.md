# 600 — Hydrogen combustion

This chapter explores **hydrogen as an aviation fuel** from a *combustion*, *thermodynamics*, and *system-level* perspective.

Rather than treating hydrogen as a simple “drop-in replacement”, the exercises in this chapter highlight how hydrogen fundamentally alters:

- combustion temperatures and equilibrium composition,
- engine cycle performance,
- aircraft range and sizing,
- onboard storage thermodynamics.

The goal is to understand **what changes, why it changes, and where the real constraints lie**.

## Learning outcomes

After completing this chapter, you should be able to:

- Explain why hydrogen combustion leads to different flame temperatures and product distributions
- Distinguish **combustion advantages** from **system-level penalties**
- Use simplified range and engine cycle models to compare fuels consistently
- Understand why storage, not combustion, is often the dominant constraint for hydrogen aircraft
- Critically assess claims about “hydrogen-powered aviation”

This chapter provides the technical basis for later discussions on feasibility, safety, and system integration.
