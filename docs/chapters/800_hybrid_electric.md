# 800 — Hybrid-electric propulsion

Hybrid-electric aircraft are not defined by a single architecture. They are defined by **power-sharing and energy management** across a mission.

This chapter uses a computational test case (via **PhlyGreen**) to explore:

- **hybridization level** and power split choices,
- battery cell assumptions and sizing,
- drivetrain efficiencies,
- mission-dependent constraints (power peaks vs energy capacity),
- where hybrid-electric helps (and where it does not).

The goal is not to “optimize” a single design, but to learn how hybridization reshapes trade-offs and constraints.

## Exercises in this chapter

### 800.1 — Hybrid-electric mission test case with PhlyGreen

A guided notebook using a Class II battery model and a prescribed hybridization strategy.
You will explore:

- power split ratio along the mission,
- battery cell properties and pack sizing,
- component efficiencies,
- hybrid-electric aircraft performance along mission,
- sensitivity of results to assumptions.

## Learning outcomes

After completing this chapter, you should be able to:

- Interpret how mission power profiles drive battery sizing and feasibility
- Identify which parameters dominate results and which are second-order
- Produce a defensible sensitivity study (rather than “turning knobs randomly”)
- Communicate hybrid-electric results with appropriate knowledge about assumptions
