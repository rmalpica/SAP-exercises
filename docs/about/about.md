# About the instructor

I am an **assistant professor in aeronautical engineering** at [Sapienza University of Roma](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/en/lecturer/aff673f85090c98cbceaeebb0e7a6322c8f83aea1acf4d8b037d916a), working at the intersection of
**aircraft propulsion**, **combustion**, and **sustainability**.


My research focuses on:
- combustion modeling (numerical and data-driven),
- reduced-order and surrogate models,
- uncertainty quantification across scales,
- system-level assessment of aircraft propulsion technologies.

What motivates my work — and this course — is the challenge of connecting
**detailed physical models** to **real-world decisions**, without hiding uncertainty
or overselling technological solutions.

## Why this repository exists

This repository is meant to support learning **through exploration**, not through recipes.

The exercises are designed to expose assumptions rather than hide them, encourage sensitivity analysis rather than point optimization, and make uncertainty visible rather than ignore it.

Models are tools for reasoning, not oracles.

If something looks too good to be true, that is usually the most interesting moment.

## What I expect from students

I do not expect perfect answers.

I do expect:

- curiosity and intellectual honesty,
- willingness to question results (including your own),
- careful interpretation rather than rushed conclusions,
- respect for uncertainty and limits.

Trying things, making mistakes, and explaining *why* something behaves as it does
is far more valuable than producing “nice” numbers.

## Practical note

This repository accompanies the *Sustainable Aircraft Propulsion* course and its lecture notes.

For questions related to the material, please follow the guidelines given during the course.
